1. **Thor (2011)**: Thor is the arrogant and reckless son of Odin, the king of Asgard. He defies his father's orders and reignites a war with the Frost Giants, who are enemies of Asgard. As a result, Odin strips him of his powers and his hammer MjÃ¶lnir, and banishes him to Earth. There, he meets and falls in love with Jane Foster, a scientist who studies cosmic phenomena. He also learns humility and courage from his human friends. Meanwhile, his brother Loki, who is secretly a Frost Giant adopted by Odin, plots to take over Asgard and destroy Thor. Thor must prove himself worthy of his hammer and his heritage, and stop Loki's evil plans.
2. **Thor: The Dark World (2013)**: Thor is now a respected warrior and protector of the Nine Realms.
